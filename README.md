# EduSense

EduSense is a real-time AI+IoT platform that augments live classroom teaching by autonomously generating structured educational contentâ€”summaries, key concepts, and quizzesâ€”from lecture audio. Designed for minimal classroom disruption and maximum learning impact, EduSense brings intelligence and adaptability to traditional education.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

EduSense aims to:

- Enhance student comprehension and retention through real-time content generation.
- Support teachers with automated feedback and pedagogical insights.
- Operate as a lightweight, deployable system that integrates seamlessly with classroom routines.

## ðŸ”§ System Overview

The system consists of:

- **Audio Capture**: Records lectures using built-in or external microphones.
- **Speech Recognition**: Uses Whisper ASR for high-fidelity transcription (WER: 2.8â€“5.0%).
- **Natural Language Processing**: Applies GPT-based models to extract key concepts and generate mini-lectures with dynamic summaries and MCQs.
- **Mobile App Interface**: Displays content to students and logs feedback.
- **Offline Syncing**: Operates in low-connectivity environments and syncs when online.

## ðŸ“Š Evaluation Highlights

- **Semantic Fidelity**: BERTScore F1 > 0.94 across summaries and quizzes.
- **User Ratings**: Students rated EduSense >4.2/5 on comprehension, usability, and usefulness.
- **Reliability**: Smooth deployment across five IoT-focused lectures with 17 undergraduates.

## ðŸ”¬ Research Contribution

EduSense demonstrates that lightweight, real-time AI integration into live classrooms is both technically feasible and pedagogically impactful, bridging a key research gap in educational AI. It combines objective metrics (WER, BERTScore) with subjective evaluations (Likert-scale surveys) to assess its effectiveness.

## ðŸ›  Future Directions

- Longitudinal studies on academic retention and performance.
- Expansion across disciplines, languages, and class sizes.
- On-device inference for lower latency and improved privacy.
- Richer content via multimodal inputs (slides, textbooks, video).
